# C# Polymorphism Practice

🧠 This project demonstrates the concept of **polymorphism** in C# through simple class-based examples.

## ✨ Topics Covered

- Inheritance and method overriding
- Virtual and override keywords
- Base class vs. derived class behavior
- Practical examples for beginners

## 🧪 Purpose

This is part of my C# learning journey. The goal is to practice object-oriented programming principles with a focus on polymorphism and clean syntax.
